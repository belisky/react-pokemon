 # About the project.
 React Pokemon is simply a frontend application that
 Serves content with the help of POKEAPI(restful CRUD)


 # Dependencies.
 In this project, I used AXIOS to help fetch the api request
 Because axios quite handles fetching requests better than the
 Default fetch in J.S
 -NO Boostrap or Tailwind or any Template of the sort.
 Just Emmet. Haha...

 # New Stuff I Learned.
 I learned how to use hooks USESTATE AND USEEFFECT HOOKS.s
 I learned pagination of a react application using boolean logic.
 This was the first time i used the fancy background-img too.

 # Looking forward.
 I wish to add Font-Awesome icons to the navigation and pagination.

 # Time Dependencies
 Took me like 15 hours to build this simple site even watching a youtube video.
 And I spent a great deal of time on the styling.
 I dunno why but I love to style just that i dont really know how to do it,
 Hence i need a lot of practice in CSS to make that happen.

 # Credits
 All credit goes to DEV-Ed React Youtube full course.
 I'm learning a great lot from him.

 My Css skills also thanks to KEVIN POWELL's responsive design course.
